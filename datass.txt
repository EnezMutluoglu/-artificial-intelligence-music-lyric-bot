                    Now that he's back in the atmosphere <br/>
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey <br/>
Acts like summer and walks like rain <br/>
Reminds me that there's time a to change, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey <br/>
But since his return from his stay on the moon <br/>
He listens like spring and she talks like June, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey<br/>
<br/>
But tell me did you sail across the sun <br/>
Did you make it to the milky way <br/>
To see the lights all faded <br/>
And that heaven is overrated<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star <br/>
One without a permanent scar <br/>
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there<br/>
<br/>
Now that he's back from that soul vacation <br/>
Tracing his way through the constellation, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey<br/>
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo <br/>
Reminds me that there's room to grow, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey <br/>
Now that he's back in the atmosphere <br/>
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane <br/>
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land<br/>
<br/>
Tell me did this wind sweep you off your feet <br/>
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day <br/>
And head back to the milky way <br/>
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind <br/>
Was it everything you wanted to find <br/>
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken <br/>
Your best friend always sticking up for you<br/>
Even when I know you're wrong <br/>
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone<br/>
Conversation <br/>
The best soy latte that you ever had and me<br/>
<br/>
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet <br/>
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day <br/>
And head back to the milky way<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star<br/>
One without a permanent scar<br/>
And did you miss my while you were looking for yourself out<br/>
<br/>
Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh ooohhhooo<br/>
Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh... <br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken <br/>
Your best friend always sticking up for you<br/>
Even when I know you're wrong <br/>
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone<br/>
Conversation <br/>
The best soy latte that you ever had and me                </div>]
