                    No one said it had to be this way<br/>
Why are we the victims of their final word<br/>
Dying world is killing us so slowly<br/>
I believe no god may save us now<br/>
<br/>
Can't you see what I see<br/>
Sinners say your prayers tonite<br/>
Your judgement day is here<br/>
<br/>
Child of tomorrow will die, not even<br/>
Born, Jesus our questions<br/>
He never seems to hear<br/>
Dying for the answers may be<br/>
The price we pay, to find the<br/>
Key to our lives<br/>
Is there a heaven is there a hell<br/>
Who's this god, tell me there's<br/>
No god above, why<br/>
<br/>
We chose what Lord, deep<br/>
Within our souls<br/>
He's not one thing,<br/>
We are his spirit<br/>
We could save this world<br/>
From destruction day<br/>
Can't you see what I see<br/>
<br/>
Can you hear me crying, yeah?<br/>
Oh God, can you help me now?<br/>
Take my hand<br/>
Oh God<br/>
<br/>
You and I victims of their word<br/>
As the masters of power<br/>
Try to poison our world<br/>
Greed money taken over<br/>
Their souls, you're<br/>
Just mechanical brains<br/>
Politicians don't know<br/>
They just don't know<br/>
<br/>
We can change this world we live in<br/>
Don't let it die                </div>]
